      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.ByteOutputBuffer.html">ByteOutputBuffer</a></h4>
      <section><p>This class provides a buffering output stream similar to
ByteArrayOutputStream, with some additional methods.</p>
<p>Once an array has been written to an output stream or to a byte array,
the object can be reused as a new stream if the reset() method is
called.</p>
<p>Unlike the ByteArrayOutputStream class, this class is not thread
safe.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.CBlkRateDistStats.html">CBlkRateDistStats</a></h4>
      <section><p>This class stores coded (compressed) code-blocks with their associated
rate-distortion statistics. This object should always contain all the
compressed data of the code-block. It is applicable to the encoder engine
only. Some data of the coded-block is stored in the super class, see
CodedCBlk.</p>
<p>The rate-distortion statistics (i.e. R-D slope) is stored for valid
points only. The set of valid points is determined by the entropy coder
engine itself. Normally they are selected so as to lye in a convex hull,
which can be achived by using the &apos;selectConvexHull&apos; method of this class,
but some other strategies might be employed.</p>
<p>The rate (in bytes) for each truncation point (valid or not) is stored
in the &apos;truncRates&apos; array. The rate of a truncation point is the total
number of bytes in &apos;data&apos; (see super class) that have to be decoded to
reach the truncation point.</p>
<p>The slope (reduction of distortion divided by the increase in rate) at
each of the valid truncation points is stored in &apos;truncSlopes&apos;.</p>
<p>The index of each valid truncation point is stored in &apos;truncIdxs&apos;. The
index should be interpreted in the following way: a valid truncation point
at position &apos;n&apos; has the index &apos;truncIdxs[n]&apos;, the rate
&apos;truncRates[truncIdxs[n]]&apos; and the slope &apos;truncSlopes[n]&apos;. The arrays
&apos;truncIdxs&apos; and &apos;truncRates&apos; have at least &apos;nVldTrunc&apos; elements. The
&apos;truncRates&apos; array has at least &apos;nTotTrunc&apos; elements.</p>
<p>In addition the &apos;isTermPass&apos; array contains a flag for each truncation
point (valid and non-valid ones) that tells if the pass is terminated or
not. If this variable is null then it means that no pass is terminated,
except the last one which always is.</p>
<p>The compressed data is stored in the &apos;data&apos; member variable of the super
class.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.EBCOTRateAllocator.html">EBCOTRateAllocator</a></h4>
      <section><p>This implements the EBCOT post compression rate allocation algorithm. This
algorithm finds the most suitable truncation points for the set of
code-blocks, for each layer target bitrate. It works by first collecting
the rate distortion info from all code-blocks, in all tiles and all
components, and then running the rate-allocation on the whole image at
once, for each layer.</p>
<p>This implementation also provides some timing features. They can be
enabled by setting the &apos;DO_TIMING&apos; constant of this class to true and
recompiling. The timing uses the &apos;System.currentTimeMillis()&apos; Java API
call, which returns wall clock time, not the actual CPU time used. The
timing results will be printed on the message output. Since the times
reported are wall clock times and not CPU usage times they can not be added
to find the total used time (i.e. some time might be counted in several
places). When timing is disabled (&apos;DO_TIMING&apos; is false) there is no penalty
if the compiler performs some basic optimizations. Even if not the penalty
should be negligeable.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.EntropyCoder.html">EntropyCoder</a></h4>
      <section><p>This abstract class provides the general interface for block-based entropy
encoders. The input to the entropy coder is the quantized wavelet
coefficients, or codewords, represented in sign magnitude. The output is a
compressed code-block with rate-distortion information.</p>
<p>The source of data for objects of this class are &apos;CBlkQuantDataSrcEnc&apos;
objects.</p>
<p>For more details on the sign magnitude representation used see the
Quantizer class.</p>
<p>This class provides default implemenations for most of the methods
(wherever it makes sense), under the assumption that the image and
component dimensions, and the tiles, are not modifed by the entropy
coder. If that is not the case for a particular implementation then the
methods should be overriden.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.LayersInfo.html">LayersInfo</a></h4>
      <section><p>This class stores the specification of a layer distribution in the bit
stream. The specification is made of optimization points and a number of
extra layers to add between the optimization points. Each optimization
point creates a layer which is optimized by the rate allocator to the
specified target bitrate. The extra layers are added by the rate allocator
between the optimized layers, with the difference that they are not
optimized (i.e. they have no precise target bitrate).</p>
<p>The overall target bitrate for the bit stream is always added as the
last optimization point without any extra layers after it. If there are
some optimization points whose target bitrate is larger than the overall
target bitrate, the overall target bitrate will still appear as the last
optimization point, even though it does not follow the increasing target
bitrate order of the other optimization points. The rate allocator is
responsible for eliminating layers that have target bitrates larger than
the overall target bitrate.</p>
<p>Optimization points can be added with the addOptPoint() method. It takes
the target bitrate for the optimized layer and the number of extra layers
to add after it.</p>
<p>Information about the total number of layers, total number of
optimization points, target bitrates, etc. can be obtained with the other
methods.</p>

      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.MQCoder.html">MQCoder</a></h4>
      <section></section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.PostCompRateAllocator.html">PostCompRateAllocator</a></h4>
      <section><p>This is the abstract class from which post-compression rate allocators
which generate layers should inherit. The source of data is a
'CodedCBlkDataSrcEnc' which delivers entropy coded blocks with
rate-distortion statistics.</p>
<p>The post compression rate allocator implementation should create the
layers, according to a rate allocation policy, and send the packets to a
CodestreamWriter. Since the rate allocator sends the packets to the bit
stream then it should output the packets to the bit stream in the order
imposed by the bit stream profiles.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.StdEntropyCoder.html">StdEntropyCoder</a></h4>
      <section><p>This class implements the JPEG 2000 entropy coder, which codes stripes in
code-blocks. This entropy coding engine can function in a single-threaded
mode where one code-block is encoded at a time, or in a multi-threaded mode
where multiple code-blocks are entropy coded in parallel. The interface
presented by this class is the same in both modes.</p>
<p>The number of threads used by this entropy coder is specified by the
&quot;jj2000.j2k.entropy.encoder.StdEntropyCoder.nthreads&quot; Java system
property. If set to &quot;0&quot; the single threaded implementation is used. If set
to &apos;n&apos; (&apos;n&apos; larger than 0) then &apos;n&apos; extra threads are started by this class
which are used to encode the code-blocks in parallel (i.e. ideally &apos;n&apos;
code-blocks will be encoded in parallel at a time). On multiprocessor
machines under a &quot;native threads&quot; Java Virtual Machine implementation each
one of these threads can run on a separate processor speeding up the
encoding time. By default the single-threaded implementation is used. The
multi-threaded implementation currently assumes that the vast majority of
consecutive calls to &apos;getNextCodeBlock()&apos; will be done on the same
component. If this is not the case, the speed-up that can be expected on
multiprocessor machines might be significantly decreased.</p>
<p>The code-blocks are rectangular, with dimensions which must be powers of
2. Each dimension has to be no smaller than 4 and no larger than 256. The
product of the two dimensions (i.e. area of the code-block) may not exceed
4096.</p>
<p>Context 0 of the MQ-coder is used as the uniform one (uniform,
non-adaptive probability distribution). Context 1 is used for RLC
coding. Contexts 2-10 are used for zero-coding (ZC), contexts 11-15 are
used for sign-coding (SC) and contexts 16-18 are used for
magnitude-refinement (MR).</p>
<p>This implementation buffers the symbols and calls the MQ coder only once
per stripe and per coding pass, to reduce the method call overhead.</p>
<p>This implementation also provides some timing features. They can be
enabled by setting the &apos;DO_TIMING&apos; constant of this class to true and
recompiling. The timing uses the &apos;System.currentTimeMillis()&apos; Java API
call, which returns wall clock time, not the actual CPU time used. The
timing results will be printed on the message output. Since the times
reported are wall clock times and not CPU usage times they can not be added
to find the total used time (i.e. some time might be counted in several
places). When timing is disabled (&apos;DO_TIMING&apos; is false) there is no penalty
if the compiler performs some basic optimizations. Even if not the penalty
should be negligeable.</p>
<p>The source module must implement the CBlkQuantDataSrcEnc interface and
code-block&apos;s data is received in a CBlkWTData instance. This modules sends
code-block&apos;s information in a CBlkRateDistStats instance.</p>

      <h4><a class="xref" href="CSJ2K.j2k.entropy.encoder.CodedCBlkDataSrcEnc.html">CodedCBlkDataSrcEnc</a></h4>
      <section><p>This interface defines a source of entropy coded data and methods to
transfer it in a code-block by code-block basis. In each call to
'getNextCodeBlock()' a new coded code-block is returned. The code-block are
retruned in no specific-order.</p>
<p>This interface is the source of data for the rate allocator. See the
&apos;PostCompRateAllocator&apos; class.</p>
<p>For each coded-code-block the entropy-coded data is returned along with
the rate-distortion statistics in a &apos;CBlkRateDistStats&apos; object.</p>
